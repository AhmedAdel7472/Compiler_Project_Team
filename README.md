# 😂 D7K Token Scanner

A **lexical analyzer (scanner)** built in Python for a fictional programming language called **D7K**.  
This tool scans source code and identifies different types of tokens such as keywords, data types, symbols, strings, and comments — just like the first stage of a compiler.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **D7K Token Scanner** reads a `.txt` source file (default: `example.txt`) line by line, uses **regular expressions** to match token patterns, and classifies each match into categories and subtypes.

It’s part of the **Compiler_Project**, demonstrating how lexical analysis works during the compilation process.

## 🧠 Features

✅ Detects **keywords**, **data types**, **symbols**, **comments**, and **strings**  
✅ Uses **regular expressions** (`re` module) for pattern matching  
✅ Prints detailed output showing:

- Line number
- Token category (e.g., `KEYWORD`, `DATA_TYPE`)
- Subtype (e.g., `IF_STATEMENT`, `INTEGER_TYPE`)
- Actual matched value

✅ Easily extensible — just add new patterns or token types in the `TOKENS` and `TOKEN_TYPES` dictionaries
